# Detection & Attribution Modelling Framework


## Objective
- The Detection Attribution Modeling Framework ([DAM]) serves the goal to orient users looking methods for detecting and disentangling the drivers of observed biodiversity change.
It **situates methods**, both *widespread* methods used in ecological studies and approaches inherited from *causal inference* or econometrics, against an ordered set of [criteria].

- The different [criteria] invite users to precisely qualify what they are looking for and what they have at hands to narrow down and suggest detection and/or attribution [methods] and tools suited to their study.



## Website structure

The DAM framework is implemented in this collaborative website and is organized around a dynamical method scheme on the landing page:

1. [Landing page]:
    - Briefly description of the framework
    - Invite users to fill in [criteria] in default order
        - Criteria default to `Unevaluated`, including all options and therefore not filtering the set of suggested methods
   
    - Method scheme
        - Gets refined with criteria assessment
        <!-- ![Illustrative scheme highlighting some methods](/assets/images/DAM_Scheme_greenHighlight.png) -->

2. The sidebar provides access to different panels grouping resource pages logically.
Its exploration in regards with the landing page is key for good use of the framework.

    1. [Good practices] panel
        
        This panel provides general resources that aim to help conceptualising and applying attribution methods. Here are page examples that fit this category:
        - Getting started 
        - Causal diagrams
        <!-- - Review articles -->
        - Compare multiple methods etc.


    1. [Criteria] panel

        This panel provides information on every criterion used to subset detection & attribution methods when using the framework. Pages follow a common documentation structure: *Definition*, *Explanation*, *Tools/rationale for helping assessment* and *Example*.

        <!-- ![criteria list](/assets/images/DAM_criteria.png) -->
         <img src="https://estopinj.github.io/dam/assets/images/DAM_criteria.png" width="220" />

    1. [Methods] panel

        This panel provides information on every method listed in the framework. The methods are described along a common documentation structure: *Description & principle*, *Reference articles*, *Implementation packages* and the *Assessment table* reflecting how the method is filtered against criteria evaluation.


    1. [Gallery] panel

        This final panel illustrates how the DAM can be used with examples, from the question + data at hands, to the criteria assessment and the method application. Examples include:
        - STOC + synthetic controls 
        - Other T3.2 applications and projectâ€™s voluntary studies 





## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.
