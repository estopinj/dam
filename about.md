## Objective
- **NaviDAM** (the Detection and Attribution Modeling Navigator) serves the goal to orient users looking methods for detecting and disentangling the drivers of observed biodiversity change.
It **situates methods**, both *widespread* methods used in ecological studies and approaches inherited from *causal inference* or econometrics, against a set of [criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/criteria).

- The different [criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/criteria) also [**invite users**]({{ site.baseurl }}/#user-input) to **specify** what they are looking for and what they have at hands thanks to **dropdown lists**.

- This enables the **narrowing down** of detection and/or attribution [**methods**]({{ site.baseurl }}/methods) and [**tools**]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools) suited to their study.


------------------------------------
## Website structure

NaviDAM is implemented in this collaborative website and is organized around a dynamical filtering tool on the landing page:

1. [Landing page (Home)]({{ site.baseurl }}/):
    - Brief description of the navigator
    - Invite users to fill in [criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/criteria) to describe their case study
        - Criteria default to `Any`, including all options and therefore not filtering the set of suggested methods

        {: .highlight}
        Incomplete assessments are reported in the output.
    
        {: .note-title }
        > **?** signs
        > 
        > Along each criterion, a **(?)** sign redirects to the description page in the [criteria]({{ site.baseurl }}/criteria) panel.

    - **Candidate methods** is the resulting list of methods that match the user requirements, organised by category. Each method can be clicked on to open the corresponding documentation page.

    - The **Graph Explorer** allows exploring, vizualizing and querying the network of methods and criteria (work in progress).
            
        - Exportable outputs: Method scheme `.png`, criteria assessment + methods `.csv`, suited method list `.txt` (work in progress)

> The sidebar provides access to different panels grouping resource pages logically.
> Its exploration in regards with the landing page is key for good use of the navigator.


{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. This *About* page providing a brief introduction to this website

1. [Criteria panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/criteria)

    This panel provides information on every criterion used to subset detection & attribution methods when using the navigator. Pages follow a common documentation structure: *Definition*, *Explanation*, *Tools/rationale for helping assessment* and *Example*.


1. [Method panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/methods)

    This panel provides information on every method listed in the navigator. The methods are described along a common documentation structure: *Description & principle*, *Reference articles*, *Implementation packages* and the *Assessment table* reflecting how the method is filtered against the user's criteria evaluation.



1. [Good practices panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/practices)
    
    This panel provides general resources that aim to help conceptualising and applying attribution methods. Here are page examples that will eventually fit this category:
    - Causal diagrams
    - Getting started 
    - Review articles
    - Comparing multiple methods etc.


1. [Gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/gallery)

    This final panel illustrates how the DAM can be used with examples, from the question + data at hands, to the criteria assessment and the method application. Examples will include:
    - STOC + synthetic controls 
    - Other T3.2 applications and projectâ€™s voluntary studies

1. The [Contributing]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributing) page that will eventually describe how to contribute to the website's content.
