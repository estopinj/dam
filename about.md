## Objective
The Detection Attribution Modeling Framework (DAM) serves the goal to orient users looking to disentangle the drivers of observed biodiversity change.
It **situates methods**, both *widespread* methods used in ecological studies and approaches inherited from *causal inference* or econometrics, against an ordered set of criteria.

The different [criteria](/criteria) invite users to precisely qualify what they are looking for and what they have at hands to narrow down and suggest detection and/or attribution [methods](/methods) and tools suited to their study.



## Website structure

The DAM framework is implemented in this collaborative website and is organized around a dynamical method scheme on the landing page:

1. [Landing page](/):
    - Briefly description of the framework
    - Invite users to fill in criteria in default order
        - Criteria default to `Unevaluated`, including all options and therefore not filtering the set of suggested methods

        {: .highlight}
        Incomplete assessments are reported in outputs.
    
        {: .note-title }
        > **?** signs
        > 
        > Along each criterion, a **?** sign redirects to the description page in the [criteria](/criteria) panel.

   
    - Method scheme
        - Gets refined/colored with criteria assessment 
            - _see feasibility_ - Is refined **each time** a criterion is informed _vs._ updated **on click only**
        - Retained methods on the scheme can be clicked on to redirect to their page in method panel 
            - _see feasibility_ - Corresponding methods are highlighted in method left bar panel 
        - Exportable outputs: refined scheme `.png`, criteria assessment + methods `.csv`, suited method list `.txt`

1. [Good practices panel](/practices)
    
    This panel provides general resources that aim to help conceptualising and applying attribution methods. Here are page examples that fit this category:
    - Getting started 
    - Causal diagrams
    <!-- - Review articles -->
    - Compare multiple methods etc.


1. [Criteria panel ](/criteria)

    The panel provides information on every criterion used to subset detection & attribution methods when using the framework. Pages follow a common documentation structure: *Definition*, *Explanation*, *Tools/rationale for helping assessment* and *Example*.


1. [Method panel](/methods)

    This panel provides information on every method listed in the framework. The methods are described along a common documentation structure: *Description & principle*, *Reference articles*, *Implementation packages* and the *Assessment table* reflecting how the method is filtered against criteria evaluation.


1. [DAM Gallery](/gallery)

    This final panel illustrates how the DAM can be used with examples, from the question + data at hands, to the criteria assessment and the method application. Examples include:
    - STOC + synthetic controls 
    - Other T3.2 applications and projectâ€™s voluntary studies
