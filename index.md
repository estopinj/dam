# **Detection & Attribution Modelling framework**


## Welcome
This website provides access to the Detection & Attribution Modelling (DAM) framework, a guide suggesting you methods suited to your project.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


- Different [criteria](/criteria) below invite users to precisely qualify _objective_, _data at hands_ and affordable _assumptions_ between others to **narrow down** and **suggest detection & attribution methods** suited to their study.
- [Methods](/methods) are further describe with dedicated pages to allow users jump start their project from the relevant ressources.

# Evaluating your project's needs

- This is in this section that users evaluate their project against the different [criteria](/criteria) of the framework.

```js
Under development.
```

![](/assets/images/DAM_criteria.png){: width="40%" }


## Results

- Illustrative scheme highlighting some mehtods
![](/assets/images/DAM_Scheme_greenHighlight.png){: width="75%" }




- Mermaid scheme example

```mermaid
graph TD;
    accTitle: the diamond pattern
    accDescr: a graph with four nodes: A points to B and C, while B and C both point to D
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/){:target="_blank"} will eventually be used to allow representing an interactive method scheme updated by the user's evaluation of the criteria.
