# Counterfactual & future simulations

 - This family includes methods that generate hypothetical or forward-looking scenarios, often by simulating system behavior under altered conditions (e.g. no intervention, future climate).
 
 - These methods are often used in climate change attribution, ecosystem projections, or to produce synthetic counterfactuals.
 
 - They are grounded in ecological, processes and are used to generate what would happen under different counterfactual or future assumptions.

**Overlap:**
Strongly interacts with Ecology-Guided Modelling (for embedding process knowledge), Causal ML (when learning-based simulators are used), and Adjusted Methods (when outputs are interpreted causally)

**Key feature:**
Focus on "what-if" scenarios

**Usage:**
Used for scenario building, forecasting, or producing synthetic data to compare against real outcomes
