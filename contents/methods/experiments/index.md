# Experiments

 - Empirical designs relying on deliberate, randomized intervention assignments, the gold standard for causal inference.
 - Experiments remove confounding by design and allow direct estimation of treatment effects. Common in ecology when feasible.

**Overlap:**
Closely related to Quasi-Experiments (when randomization is partial or approximate) and Adjusted Methods (when additional covariate control is needed)

**Key feature:**
Random assignment of treatment

**Usage:**
For establishing causality under minimal assumptions
