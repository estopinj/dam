# Quasi-experiments

 - Exploits natural or accidental variation in exposure that mimics random assignment.
 - These methods do not require randomized treatment but instead leverage external structures (e.g. thresholds, timing, policies) to approximate experimental conditions.
 - They exploit natural experiments or discontinuities in treatment assignment to estimate causal effects.

**Overlap:**
 Shares conceptual ground with Experiments, Adjusted Methods (often combined with covariate control), and Independent Detection (for identifying breakpoints)

**Key feature:**
Use of non-random but plausibly exogenous variation

**Usage:**
For causal inference using observational data where assignment approximates randomness
