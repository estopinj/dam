## Description & principle

Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) is a nonlinear, data-driven, equation-free method used to infer causality between time series in complex systems {% cite sugihara2012detecting %}. Rooted in the framework of Empirical Dynamical Modeling, it builds on the principle that in a deterministic dynamic system, each variable is influenced by the underlying system's state and therefore carries embedded information about other variables it interacts with. Thus, according to Takens' Theorem the full dynamics of a system can be reconstructed from time-delayed observations of a single variable through state-space embedding. This reconstruction yields what is referred to as a shadow manifold: a geometrical representation of the system’s attractor reconstructed from a single observed variable, using delay coordinates. For a time series X(t), its shadow manifold M<sub>X</sub> is constructed using delay coordinates:

M<sub>X</sub>(t)={X(t),X(t−τ),X(t−2τ),...,X(t−(E−1)τ)}

where τ is the time delay and E is the embedding dimension. The manifold M<sub>X</sub>​ approximates the true system attractor, preserving its topological properties under suitable conditions.

Within this framework, if a variable X causally influences variable Y, then the shadow manifold reconstructed from Y (denoted M<sub>Y</sub>) will contain information about X. CCM tests this by attempting to reconstruct (or "cross-map") the values of X using delay coordinates of Y, with nearest neighbors in the shadow manifold reconstructed from Y having to correspond to close values of X, using time indices to make the correspondence. This procedure is based on the assumption that nearby points in the reconstructed manifold correspond to nearby states of the full dynamical system. Therefore, if M<sub>Y</sub>​ is a valid reconstruction of the system attractor and X is dynamically coupled to Y, then similar states in M<sub>Y</sub> should correspond to similar values of X. If such reconstruction improves as the length of the time series used to construct the manifold increases, which refers to the “convergence” criteria of CCM, we will conclude that X is a causal driver of Y.

A strength of this approach is that it allows for asymmetric inference: the fact that M<sub>Y</sub> can reconstruct X, and therefore that X causes Y, does not imply that the reverse is true. CCM also allows for the detection of bidirectional causality (X ↔ Y), though extensions of the method, e.g. {% cite ye2019functional %} are needed to differentiate true feedback from spurious correlations due to shared drivers or strong coupling.

## Major variants
{: .no_toc }

Several variants are available to deal with common challenges arising from ecological data:
- **Multispatial CCM**: combines spatially replicated observations via bootstrapping, enabling to work with shorter time series {% cite clark2015spatial %}, implemented in R/Python package fastEDM
- **Baysian versions of EDM**: rely on (Deep) Gaussian Processes (GP) regressions (e.g. GP-CCM), combining short time series in a hierarchical model structure to increase forecast precision, addressing cases of short time series or noisy data {% cite munch2017circumventing feng2019detecting ghouse2021inferring %}
- **Partial Cross-Mapping**: integrates partial correlation to distinguish direct from indirect causal links, as described by {% cite leng2020partial --style _bibliography/narrative %}; a multi-variate variant is in development, as described by {% cite zhang2025mxmap --style _bibliography/narrative %}.
