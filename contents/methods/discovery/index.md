# Causal discovery

 - Aims to infer the underlying causal structure (often a Directed Acyclic Graph) from data using conditional independencies, scores, or stability assumptions.
 - A set of algorithms that attempt to uncover causal graphs from observational data using conditional independence, score-based optimization, or asymmetries.

**Overlap:**
Informs Adjusted Methods & Quasi-experiments (by discovering adjustment sets), supports Causal ML (by identifying variable roles), and relates to Alternative Paradigms when standard graph assumptions are relaxed

**Key feature:**
Infers causal structure

**Usage:**
For learning causal DAGs, discovering/detecting exposure pathways
