# Causal Machine Learning

 - Integrates causal inference principles with machine learning models to estimate treatment effects or counterfactual outcomes.
 - These ML-based methods are built for high-dimensional or flexible modeling but are tailored for questions of cause-effect rather than pure prediction.
 - They rely on combining outcome modeling with design-based techniques.
 - Often use sample splitting, meta-learners, and regularization to improve robustness and flexibility.
