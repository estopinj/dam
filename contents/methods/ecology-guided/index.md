# Ecology-guided Modelling

 - Models built around ecological theory, constraints, or expert knowledge.
 - These models are usually statistical or mechanistic and are designed to be ecologically plausible and interpretable.
 - They may not estimate causal effects directly unless specific assumptions or designs are used.
 - This family captures statistical models that are informed by ecological theory or structure.

**Overlap:**
Shares borders with Counterfactual Simulations (when mechanistic), Adjusted Methods (when covariate adjustment is applied)

**Key feature:**
Ecological theory and process-based structure

**Usage:**
Often used to test ecological hypotheses or represent ecological processes
