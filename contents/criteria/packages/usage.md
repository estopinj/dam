# Packages

|  **Option**        | **Description**            |
|:------------------:|----------------------------|
| `User-friendly` | Intuitive functions, minimal coding, turnkey tutorials. |
| `Technical but well documented` | Requires coding but has comprehensive guides. |
| `Sparse documentation` | Few examples; steep learning curve. | 
| `Domain-specific skills` | Requires niche expertise. |


## Definition
The level of user-friendliness, including documentation quality, interface design, and required expertise. 

## Explanation
Guides the steepness of the learning curve and risk of misuse. User-friendly methods have intuitive interfaces and tutorials; technical methods require coding or domain knowledge; sparse documentation methods pose high barriers. 

## Tools/rationale for helping assessment
1. Clarify your project’s priority: rapid prototyping and proofs-of-concept, reproducible pipelines, or bespoke mechanistic exploration & deep customization. 
2. If you need a turnkey solution with minimal coding, choose `User-friendly`. 
3. If you require robust, reproducible code and can handle technical scripts and details, choose `Technical but well-documented`. 
4. If you are planning to invest significant efforts and are comfortable with applying/learning domain-specific algorithms, choose `Domain-specific skills`.

## Example
A national park authority needs to quickly produce RS-based deforestation reports for stakeholders with no coding staff, so they need a `User-friendly` tool with point-and-click workflows and default parameter settings.
