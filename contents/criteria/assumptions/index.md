# Assumptions

- This third and largest category of criteria gathers the assumptions that the suggested models must respect or, at the opposite, relax.
- They depend heavily on system knowledge, which conditions what users can reasonably assume.
- Some assumptions are model-specific, while others are common to, for instance, the Structural Causal Model.
