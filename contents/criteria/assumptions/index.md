# Assumptions

- This third and largest category of criteria gathers the assumptions that the suggested models must respect or, at the opposite, can relax.
- They depend heavily on system knowledge, which conditions users can reasonably assume.
- Some assumptions are model-specific, while others are common to, for instance, the Structural Causal Model.

    > Some assumptions may therefore appear irrelevant to studies not formulated in the corresponding paradigm. In this case, NaviDAM contributors can pick `Inapplicable` and users let the `Any` option.
