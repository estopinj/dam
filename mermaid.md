- Mermaid scheme example

```mermaid
graph TD;
    accTitle: the diamond pattern
    accDescr: a graph with four nodes: A points to B and C, while B and C both point to D
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/){:target="_blank"} will eventually be used to allow representing an interactive method scheme updated by the user's evaluation of the criteria.
